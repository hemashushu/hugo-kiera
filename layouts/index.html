                    <p><em>XiaoXuan Language</em> is an elegant, full-stack programming language.
                        It consists of several variants and can be used to develop a variety applications,
                        including digital circuits and chips,
                        microcontroller programs, GPU shaders, native programs, system programs,
                        service programs, web applications and more.
                        All variants use the same syntax and design philosophy, allowing you to learn
                        one language for all domains of development.
